This is my work from my previous internship as a data analyst in an early startup which focuses on education for UMKM. The work is about Instagram marketing content analysis to find which kind of contents is the most viral.
Here, I used Pandas and Seaborn library to do the analyses and make visualization which I used to make a report to be presented for the marketing department.
